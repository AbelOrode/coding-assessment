## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_Given more time, I would have implemented the filtration functions for movie genre, year, and type for task 2 assessment. However, I got my logic wrong and spent more time debugging, adn I am currently working on it to get it done. Notwithstanding, I was able to implement the sorting functionality by movie title_

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_As required, I followed the instructions as specified in the project requirements, however, I had challenges implementing the select multi-check element due to time constraint, and how to loop through multidimensional array values using Vue.js. However, through this assessment, I have learned Vue.js  core concepts, and how it offers a productive approach to web applications._


##Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
_Yes, and thank you for asking. Naturally, I am a curious individual. I spent more of time and resources learning and writing computer software code to add value in new ways. I am seeking this opportunity not just for personal and professional growth, but to thrive on new challenges while having the opportunity to work with hubspot creative web development team, and more importantly, contribute towards the development of hubspot as a company. Moreover, I just want to bring to your attention that I am currently working on a personal project titled 'Sales Inventory System'. This is a Single Page Application which can be utilized to simultaneously track sales activity in addition to inventory._
