## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_Although I successfully completed the two-way data binding to update the movie title based on user input, given more time I would have implemented the filtration functions for movie genre, year, and type, for task 2 assessment._

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_On task 2, I had challenges retrieving multiple array values of the media genre object. And due to the limited time I had, I  retrieved the data from the endpoint, looped over each element, and then displayed each movie genre array value individually using a select statement instead of multi-checkbox select element._


##Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
_Yes, and thank you for asking. Naturally, I am a curious individual. I am passionate about software technologies, and  spend more of time and resources learning and writing computer software code to add value in new ways. I am seeking this opportunity not just for personal and professional growth, but to thrive on new challenges while having the opportunity to work with hubspot creative web development team, and more importantly, to contribute towards the development of hubspot as a company._
